# Snapmaker2Postprocessor

## Overview
This project provides a postprocessor for the [Path Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Path_Workbench) of [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org) compatible with the CNC module of [Snapmaker 2.0](https://snapmaker.com) (and possibly newer) machines.

It converts FreeCAD internal GCODE generated by the Path Workbench into GCODE suitable for Snapmaker 2.0 machines.
Its functions cover:
- Snapmaker CNC commands
- tool change between operations (by inserting a HMI pause (M76))
- drilling (by converting G81-G83 commands)
- thumbnail generation for HMI
- rapid moves (speed is not added by FreeCAD to GCODE)

## Usage
Move the `Snapmaker_2_CNC_post.py` file to the FreeCAD macros directory. It should appear within the list of postprocessors of the Path workbench. 

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/clsergent/Snapmaker2Postprocessor/wiki) if you need more information.

Refer to [FreeCAD documentation](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Path_Post) on how to use a postprocessor.


## Limitations
This postprocessor has been tested on FreeCAD 0.20, 0.21 and 0.22 shipped with python3.8+.
Generated GCODE should work on any Snapmaker 2 and newer machine, but has only been tested on the following ones:
- A350
- A250
- Artisan

No warranty of any kind is provided, so be cautious as you use this postprocessor at your own risks. 
If you encounter any bug, please open an issue.
